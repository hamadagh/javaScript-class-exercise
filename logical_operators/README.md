**Logical Operators Exercises**

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with logical operators. **Print all your checks to the console.**
**Every capitalized word stands for the logical operator that you must use in each task.** Make sure that you are using the correct logical operator. 

Declare two variables "a" with the value of true and "b" with the value of false. 

1. Check the result of a AND b. 

2. Check the result of a OR b. 

3. Check the result of NOT a AND b. 

4. Declare three more variables "x", "y", "z". Give these variables number values. 

5. Check the result of whether x is greater than z AND x is greater than y. 

6. Check the result of whether x is NOT equal to y. 

7. Check the result of whether z is less than y OR z is greater than x. 

8. Check the result of whether x is equal to z OR x is NOT equal to y.

9. Check the result of whether x is greater than or equal to 10 AND y is less than or equal to 10. 

10. Check the result of whether x multiplied by z is less than 100 OR whether x multiplied by y is greater than 100.
