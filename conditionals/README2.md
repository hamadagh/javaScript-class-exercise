#Conditionals P2
##Don't forget to print your results to the console!

1. Make a variable for firstName and age and give each variable values. Create an if/else statement to check whether the person's age is less than 13. If so, print "firstName is a boy/girl". If the age is equal to or more than 13 and less than 20, print "firstName is a teenager". If the person's age is equal to 20 and less than 30, then print "firstName is a young man/woman". If none of these conditions apple, print "firstName is a man/woman". 

2. Make an if/else statement depending on a person's job. 
Create two variables "firstName" and "job". 
Print 4 different outputs depending on the value of "job" eg. "Maria is a teacher in Berlin" / "Maria is a designer in Berlin". 
Make 5 different possible outcomes depending on the value of job.

3. Check if a number is divisible by 3. If it is, print "Fizz". Check if a number is divisible by "5". If it is, print "Buzz". Check is a number is divisible by both 3 and 5. If it is, print "FizzBuzz". If none of the above apply, print the number. 

4. Make an if/else statement depending on the weather today!
Create a variable named "temperature" and "weather".
Then, create outputs based on the variable values e.g.
if ((temperature > 15) && (weather === 'sunny') {
    console.log(`It is ${temperature} degrees outside and ${weather}`.
}

>Do this for at least 3 different outputs.

5. Calculate the student average mark and then give the student a grade. 

student marks = 90, 64, 75, 83, 80, 55

- A+ if the average is greater than 90. 
- A if the average is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90	. 
- B+ if the average is greater than 70 and less than or equal to 80. 
- B if the average is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70. 
- C+ if the average is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60. 
- C if the average is greater than 40  and less than or equal to 50. 
- D if the average is greater than 30 and less than or equal to 40. 
- F if the average is less than or equal to 30.
