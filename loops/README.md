# Loops
## Practising for loops. Print all your results to the console.

1. Addition 
Write a program to add up the numbers 1 to 20.

2. There are i bottles of beer on the wall. 
Write a program that will output, "There is one bottle of beer on the wall." "There are two bottles of beer on the wall" etc. 

3. The odd/even reporter
Write a program that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

4. Multiplication Tables
Write a program that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
**Bonus**: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).

5. Grades
Write a program to calculate the average marks of the following students Then, this average is used to determine the corresponding grade for the class. 
John	90
Tom	60
Jane	77
Maria	81
Carl	65

The marks are graded as follows :
Range	Grade
<60	F
<70	D
<80	C
<90	B
<100	A
>

6. Fizz Buzz
Write a program which iterates the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

7. Sum of Multiples
Write a program to add the multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000.

8. Create an array filled with your friends' and family's names. Loop over the array and greet each friend e.g. Hello Maria! Hello Mike! etc. 

**Bonus**: Print the indexes of each item in the array. Expected output example: Mike is at index 1 of my friends array. 

9. Write a program that will output the following using loops: 
>100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000
>1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128
>0 2 4 6 8 10
>3 6 9 12 15
>9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

10. isPalindrome
Write a program to check whether a word is a palindrome or not. 
Note: a palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or tarrattarrat
