# jQuery Drop Down

## Create a drop down menu

* Create a navbar that contains 5 list items. When the user clicks each list item, a drop down menu of three items should appear. In the mock up image provided, there are five movie names. When the user clicks one, a drop down menu appears with the names of the three main actors. 
* If another movie title is clicked, the previous one closes and the new one opens.

**Hint**: You may want to create a class like 'shown' to make the dropdown list visible. When the link is clicked you may want to toggle this class to that specific menu item.

* Once you are finished with writing the code in vanilla JS, convert your code to Jquery.
