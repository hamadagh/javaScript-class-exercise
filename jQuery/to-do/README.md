# jQuery To-Do List

## Create a to-do list 

* Create an application by using html, css and vanilla js. 
* The application should have an input text field inside a form and a button for submitting. 
* The user should be able to write any task in the input field and then see the task as a list item below. 
* Any time the form is submitted (by either hitting enter on the field, or by clicking the button) a new list item should be created with the text of the content of the input field
* The more tasks you add, the more list items appear.

**Once you have finished writing this code in vanilla JS, convert your code into jQuery.**

**Bonus**: Every list item should have a 'delete' button. When clicked, it should delete the list item. The 'delete' button should be created inside every list item.
